Tiff-Sorter
===========

A quick and porrly-written project for a relative.

Uses swing and java to take in a multi page tiff file, and pages through it
prompting for names. Then writes out the files with the given names as png
files. Uncommented, poorly written, and arbitrarily changing coding standards
in a few places. This was a "finish quick as possible in an afternoon because I
have other things I need to be doing" project. Java only because I know it well
